# Haxe Roundup № 358

Welcome to the latest edition of the Haxe Roundup. [Haxe](http://haxe.org/?utm_source=haxe.io) is a high level, strictly typed programming language and cross-compiler.

## News from the Community

### News and Articles

The [World Wide Haxe Conference 2016 crowd-funding](https://en.ulule.com/wwx2016/) campaign officially [launched](https://twitter.com/silexlabs/status/707197540819714048) last week! The campaign currently stands at `21%` funded!

It turns out that Structured Canvas Language, [SCL](https://twitter.com/SCLanguage), was [created](https://twitter.com/SCLanguage/status/707271415607615488) with
using Haxe.

Nicolas's first Friday live stream about the compilation server has been [written up](http://haxe.org/blog/nicolas-about-haxe-episode-1) over on the HF blog, which is great, considering that the recording failed to save.

I'm particularly excited by this, [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevinresol) has
decided to start documenting [UFront](http://ufront.net/), the **official** Haxe web framework. Documentation is desperately needed for UFront and 
Kevin's efforts are a great start. You can read the guides [here](https://github.com/kevinresol/ufront-nodejs-guide/).

[Ohmnivore](https://twitter.com/4_AM_Games) has published an updated to
Peasant Knight, made with HaxeFlixel, over on [TIGForums](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=52263.msg1229230#msg1229230). Checkout the [Flash](http://fouramgames.com/swf/peasantknight.html) or [Windows](http://fouramgames.com/dl/PeasantKnight.zip) demos, if your as 
bad as I am, you will die loads on _level 1_.

[FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=12584&sid=5a4268c582cb09e54e37104f45517c61) and [HaxeDevelop](http://haxedevelop.org/download.html) have released version 
`5.1.1`, which contain minor changes and bug fixes.

### *Some* library releases

I'm particularly interested in quite a few library releases from the past
week.

[Carlos Ballesteros Velasco](https://github.com/soywiz) has released two
libraries, [haxe-ws `0.0.4`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-ws) and
[haxe-crypto `0.0.3`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-crypto).

[Haxe-ws](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-ws) provides WebSockets to **every**
compiler target supported by Haxe.

[Haxe-crypto](http://lib.haxe.org/p/haxe-crypto) is a port of [Hurlant crypto](http://crypto.hurlant.com/) to Haxe, bringing a pure implementation of the TLS `1.0` protocol, public and secret key encryption protocol and _so_ 
much more. But it turned out that Haxe already had a port of [ASCrypt](https://github.com/Meychi/ASCrypt) available for the last _year_.

[Brendan Graetz](https://github.com/bguiz) has created [hxstruct](https://github.com/bguiz/hxstruct), a collection of general purpose data structures and algorithms written in Haxe. It will be interesting
to see how this library turns out.

If your writing externs for the Php target or just need native access, 
consider looking into [Yaroslav Sivakov's](https://bitbucket.org/yar3333/) [phpnatives](http://lib.haxe.org/p/phpnatives) library.

[Asciiascetic](https://github.com/asciiascetic) has started 
[Farcek](https://github.com/asciiascetic/farcek), a small parser combinator 
library inspired by Haskell's Parsec. Even though in the `README` it says 
_“the library prioritizes for ease of use over performance”_, it will be
interesting to see how the library turns out and compares to others. There is
an older, existing library, [Parsex](https://github.com/sledorze/Parsex/) to
consider.

- [json-rpc `1.2.1`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/json-rpc)
- [extern-js-glob `git`](https://github.com/ExternKit/extern-js-glob)
- [farcek `1.1.2`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/farcek)
- [HaQuery `6.7.1`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/HaQuery)
- [jsfl `1.2.0`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/jsfl)
- [refactor `3.1.1`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/refactor)
- [stdlib `2.0.4`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/stdlib)
- [hxnodejs `4.0.4`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/hxnodejs)
- [slidrr `git`](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/slidrr)
- [robotlegs `0.3.0`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/robotlegs)
- [starling `0.5.1`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/starling)
- [mime `0.0.0`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/mime)
- [pyscript `0.0.1`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/pyscript)
- [monsoon `0.0.2`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/monsoon)
- [ithril `1.0.8`](http://lib.haxe.org/p/ithril)
- [python-ast `git`](https://github.com/nadako/python-ast)

## Updates from the Haxe core

77 commits have been made to Haxe compiler in the [last week].

- Haxelib library install counter has been [fixed](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxelib/commit/58aecbca8dc0305b016f1b3b59dae1a9d3577a62).
- Add `socket_set_keepalive` for Neko [pull request](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/neko/pull/117) merged.
- Rewrite the Haxe [pattern matcher](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/4940) pull request and 
ongoing discussion.
- Use the path given in `--display` instead of `Common.find_file` result [pull request](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/4943). _Of 
interest to IDE plugin authors_.

You can start using the latest features by grabbing a [nightly build] of Haxe.

Have a good week everyone!
